Smart Dormitory is an information system that collects data from various sensors located in 
college dormitories all over the world. Data will be analyzed by independent research organization 
to evaluate the living conditions and map them to the performance of the students.

The Smart Dormitory application lets you create and conveniently visualize data from sensors for it to be further analyzed.
With the Smart Dormitory app you can also:
•	Create sensors
•	Edit sensors
•	Visualize the sensors on the world map using Bing Maps
•	Track the current value of every sensor and observe all the sensors at once from the dashboard
•	Observe a lot of sensors at once and be informed if some of them have data out of the bounds of the sensor values.

On application startup the user will be greeted by the Smart Dormitory logo:

After fully loading, the logo will disappear presenting the user with the Dashboard. 
This is where all sensors along with their data is visualized. Each sensor type is 
portrayed with a different gauge which displays the current value of the sensor and 
alerts the user with a contrasting color shift on abnormal values.

Navigation between views of the application is contained within a 
drawer which can be opened by the hamburger icon located in the top left corner of the screen.

Its contents:
1.	Dashboard – this is the main page of the app where you can view all the followed sensors via animated gauges.
2.	Sensors – in this page you can add or edit sensors. Also, you can follow/unfollow them (toggle their visibility on the dashboard) or view a chosen sensor on the world map.
3.	Map – a world map made which shows the location of all sensors.
4.	About – a page about the creators and the people who helped throughout the development of this project.

To add a new sensor, all fields in the form need to be filled out:

1.	Choose a proper Name for the sensor. Name must be at least 3 symbols.
2.	Choose a sensor Type from the Combo Box.
3.	Set Min and Max acceptable values for the sensor.
4.	Set Latitude and Longitude geocoordinates in decimal format for the sensor for its 
	location to be displayed on the map.
5.	Link the sensor with a sensor from the Smart Dormitory API.
6.	Choose whether you want to track the sensor by tapping on the green button between the 
	“Link with sensor” and “Description” fields.
7.	Add an informative and succinct Description of the sensor.


Once your desired and valid sensor information has been entered, choose Submit. 
If you wish to abort the creation of the sensor, press Cancel and all information entered will be discarded.
